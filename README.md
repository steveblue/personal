# Steve Belovarich's Personal Site

I made this site with Readymade, a microlibrary for web components I coded to make developing with custom elements easier.


### Made With The Readymade Starter

Starter code for developing Readymade projects built with Parcel.

Developing projects with Web Components can seem daunting without sophisticated tooling.

Parcel brings the following to developing Web Components with Readymade.

- zero config bundling and optimization
- code splitting and lazyloading
- fast build times through caching and hot module replacement
- import component style and template from separate files
- css and html pre / postprocessing
- typescript compilation

### Installation

To get started, fork and clone the repo. Install dependencies with yarn.

`yarn install`

### Development

`yarn dev` starts up a local development server with code splitting, hot module replacement enabled by default. The first build takes longer. After the cache is populated the "hello world" project loads in ~1 second.

For more information about Parcel, read the official [documentation](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html).

The project is viewable at `http://localhost:4444`.

### Source

The default project is split into two directories found in the `src` directory: `client` and `server`. The server portion is only used in the production build.

### Production

`yarn prod` builds the project for production. Found in the `dist` directory, the production build optimizes the html, css and javascript.

Run `yarn serve` to check the production build locally at `http://localhost:4444`.
